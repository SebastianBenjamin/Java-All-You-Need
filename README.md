##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Tomcat or similar (for web modules)
- MySQL or any SQL database (for JDBC/Hibernate examples)
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency and build management)
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

### Usage Instructions

#### Running Core Java & DSA Examples
1. Navigate to an example directory.
2. Compile: `javac ExampleName.java`
3. Run: `java ExampleName`

#### Running Web-based Modules (Servlets, JSP, etc.)
1. Build with Maven or Gradle: `mvn clean install` or equivalent.
2. Deploy WAR to your servlet container (e.g., move `.war` to Tomcat’s `webapps`).
3. Access via: `http://localhost:8080/ModuleName`

#### Running JDBC, Hibernate & Spring Examples
1. Set database credentials in configuration files (e.g., `hibernate.cfg.xml`).
2. Build and run the application (using `Main.java` or IDE Run).
3. For Spring – use `Main.java` or embedded server run configurations.
